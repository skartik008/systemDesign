# Relational database management system (RDBMS)

## A relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.

- **Atomicity** - Each transaction is all or nothing
- **Consistency** - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
- **Isolation** - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
- **Durability** - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so
